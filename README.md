# dev-salary-estimator
A salary estimator for IT professionals, leveraging Deep Learning, Azure Functions and React.

## Description
This project aims to provide an approximate calculation of the sallary that an IT proffesional living in Greece can expect to receive, based on their profile.

The inputs taken into consideration include:
- Years of experience
- Company Size
- Work Model (Hybrid/Remote/On Premise)
- Are of Expertise (Front/Backend Development, Mobile, DevOps, CyberSecurity...)
- Languages & Technologies

This project consists of three main main components:
- The Notebook, used to create the model
- The Back-End application to perform the calculation
- The Front-End application for the user to interact with

## Notebook
The notebook used to create this project is based on [sn_salary_forecast_2020](https://gist.github.com/ntakouris/6afc4352678e779c95f1714d2b6ec8ab#file-sn_salary_forecast_2020-ipynb) by [Theodoros Ntakouris](https://gist.github.com/ntakouris). The datased used to train the model is the 2022 Developer Salary Questionaire by the [Social Nerds](https://www.youtube.com/@SocialNerdsGR). I would like to thank both, as this project would not have been possible.
